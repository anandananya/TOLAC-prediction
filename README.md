# TOLAC-prediction

This repository contains code and resources to analyze and predict outcomes related to Trial of Labor After Cesarean (TOLAC). The project processes natality data and performs predictive analysis using Python and R.

## Files and Scripts

### `make_csv.py`
A Python script to process natality data files for multiple years. It:
- Reads fixed-width natality data files (e.g., `Nat2016.txt` to `Nat2023.txt`).
- Filters the data for relevant fields and conditions.
- Outputs processed CSV files into the `csv_files/` directory.

If you would rather like to do this in R:

### `Natality_createcsv.R`
An R script to process natality data and generate cleaned CSVs. It serves as an alternative to the Python implementation.

### `Natality_logreg.R`
An R script that performs logistic regression analysis to predict TOLAC outcomes based on natality data.

### `csv_files/`
This directory contains the processed CSV files generated by the `make_csv.py` or `Natality_createcsv.R` scripts.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- R with necessary libraries (`readr`, `data.table`, etc.)
- Pandas (install via `pip install pandas`)

### Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anandananya/TOLAC-prediction.git
cd TOLAC-prediction
