# TOLAC-prediction

This repository contains code and resources to analyze and predict outcomes related to Trial of Labor After Cesarean (TOLAC). The project processes natality data and performs predictive analysis using Python and R.

## Files and Scripts

### `Python_files/make_csv.py`
A Python script to process natality data files for multiple years. It:
- Reads fixed-width natality data files (e.g., `Nat2016.txt` to `Nat2023.txt`).
- Filters the data for relevant fields and conditions.
- Outputs processed CSV files into the `csv_files/` directory.

If you would rather like to do this in R:

### `R_files/Natality_createcsv.R`
An R script to process natality data and generate cleaned CSVs. It serves as an alternative to the Python implementation.

### `R_files/Natality_logreg.R`
An R script that performs logistic regression analysis to predict TOLAC outcomes based on natality data.

### `Python_files/logreg.py`
A Python script that performs logistic regression analysis on natality data. Users can specify their own CSV file as input via the command line:
```bash
python Python_files/logreg.py path/to/your_data.csv
```

### `csv_files/`
This directory contains the processed CSV files generated by the `make_csv.py` or `Natality_createcsv.R` scripts.
